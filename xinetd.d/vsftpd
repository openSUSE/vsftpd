#   The vsftpd FTP server serves FTP connections. It uses
#   normal, unencrypted usernames and passwords for authentication.
# vsftpd is designed to be secure.
#
# NOTE: This file contains the configuration for xinetd to start vsftpd.
#       the configuration file for vsftp itself is in /etc/vsftpd.conf
#
# NOTE: Remember to set both listen and listen_ipv6 to NO in /etc/vsftpd.conf
#       in order to have working xinetd connection.
